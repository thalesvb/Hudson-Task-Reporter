This project aims to make management reports from Hudson-CI tasks logs using the
Appy Framework. I chose this framework because of Python Open Document, don't
have any external dependency and is Python, language that Hudson accepts scripts
to be invoked.
It's still in early stages, so the majority of artifacts is on my native 
language. By the time i'll translate them to English.
