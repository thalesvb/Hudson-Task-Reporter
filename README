This project aims to make management reports from Hudson-CI tasks logs using the
Appy Framework. I chose this framework because of Python Open Document, don't
have any external dependency and is Python, language that Hudson accepts scripts
to be invoked.
It's built to be invoked on CLI with Python and later send generated odt by e-mail.
To this tool work you need to already have installed the Appy Framework
(http://appyframework.org/).
It's still in early stages, so the majority of artifacts is on my native language.
By the time i'll translate them to English.
